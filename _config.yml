    Thank you for being here.
    This is a simple GitHub Page built by a random GitHub beginner in the worst times of the decade.
  In 2020, we have Covid 19, an unstable political environment, and the possibility of global recession.
  All of us are participating in these significant historial events.
  Life may be tough but you are not alone.
    Have a good day!
